										<p>
											This is an innovative data management course that provides an introduction
                      to the design and development of fundamental concepts in relational database
                      management systems (DBMS). You will learn the theory and design behind database
											systems, the issues that affect their functionality and performance, and
											most importantly, what it takes to effectively utilize modern databases in practice.

											<br><br>

                      The course has completely been redesigned; all students are expected to work
                      in groups of five on an exciting, open-ended, data-oriented, quarter-long project,
                      in a sense, operating and simulating startup environments. Needless to say,
                      this rewarding experience is accompanied by a significant development effort (in Python)
                      that spans hands-on experience on concepts such as memory and disk management,
											synchronization and concurrency, logging and recovery, and query optimization
											and evaluation, to name a few. To materialize these objectives, together this quarter,
											we will be building simplified <b style="font-weight: bold">L-Store</b>
											[<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324150481_L-Store_A_Real-time_OLTP_and_OLAP_System" target="_blank">Paper</a>, <a href="ecs165a-winter2026/lectures/L-Store Storage Architecture.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a>]
											from scratch, an Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database.

											<br><br>

                      The coursework is complementary to the classical well-formed, prescriptive
											model of assignments/projects that are indeed effective and invaluable in practice.
                      Instead by design, the project is intended to be open-ended, namely, minimal
                      instructions and requirements will be provided, as such it rewards and values
                      research & development, taking risks, above all, it is aimed to foster and
                      tap into the creativity of each individual.

											<br><br>

											The quarter-long project is broken into a set of three milestones. The entire grade will
											be determined by the <a href="https://lstore.resilientdb.com" target="_blank">autograder</a>,
											and it will further be examined by TAs for accuracy and misuse of AI code generation.

											<br><br>

											Furthermore, in each milestone, a bonus of up to 10% can be gained to further encourage
											taking a risk, going the extra mile, and to just be curious &amp; creative. The
											bonus is reserved for the fastest and the most optimized implementation of L-Store in
											class, e.g., how many read/write operations per second (adjusted based on the number of
											cores, CPU clock frequency, amount of memory, cache size, and other hardware metrics to
											ensure comparable results).

											<br><br>

											A fact of life is that when there is group work, whether at school or in society,
                      there are occasional conflicts; it is crucial to learn how to
                      resolve our differences and be receptive, open, and kind to one another. In
                      kindness and reflection, we shall aim to resolve all conflicts. It is the group
											responsibility to handle all internal affairs, and only when absolutely necessary
											involving the instructor. But note, only under very rare exceptional circumstances,
											a group re-structuring would be granted because once the group is formed, at least
											for 10 weeks, we must learn how to work with each other in harmony.

											<br><br>

                      For each group, it is recommended that each member lead one aspect of the project
											while contributing and learning about other parts; roughly, the main components
											are
											(1) memory management (e.g., bufferpool),
											(2) disk management (e.g., persistence and logging),
											(3) in-memory indexing (e.g., hashing or tree),
											(4) data access methods (e.g., APIs and query language),
											(5) multi-threading and synchronization (e.g., data structures latching),
											(6) transaction and concurrency (e.g., record-level locking), and
											(7) testing and benchmarking (correctness verification and performance measurements).

											<br><br>

											<h3 align="left"><b style="font-weight: bold">Workload:</b></h3>

											The key component of the course is the quarter-long group project that is broken
											into a set of three main milestones. All milestones may be graded orally (unless
											specified otherwise), where the progress is presented by all group members, and
											each group member must be ready to answer questions about any aspect of the project;
											the latter is of the utmost importance to ensure a comprehensive learning experience
											and a fair division of work among all members.

											<br><br>

											For each milestone, each group must submit an attribution section in which they specifically
											state each person's role and the percentage of their contribution. In a group of 5, it is expected
											that a person will complete 15-20% of the overall project. Of course, determining the percentage
											is approximate, but the point is that every member contributes fairly.
											<b style="font-weight: bold">No contribution means a grade of 0.</b>

											Additionally, there will be a pre-milestone individual assignment for which each student
											is expected to think about and explore all aspects of the project. In other words,
											each student needs to think about what is required to make an HTAP
											database and document their finding in a few pages. Of course, it is highly
											recommended to search the web for tutorials and other useful materials. As part this
											pre-milestone phase, (1) the group must be formed, namely, when each student submits their
											report, the name of their group members and their <i>team name</i> must be submitted;
											and (2) each student must decide which aspect of the project they wish to lead-based
											on the research. If you need help to form your group and look for partners, kindly
											contact the TAs. Note any group assignment by TAs will be random. Additionally,
											An online form will be made available for you to submit your team details.

											<br><br>

											All students are required to attend every lecture and ask insightful questions.
											Additionally, in order to encourage class participation, there will be short and exciting pop
											quizzes. We expect to have 3-5 quizzes spread throughout the quarter. The lowest quiz score will
											be dropped, but there will be no opportunity for makeup quizzes unless there are exceptional
											circumstances or illness (doctor notes are required). If a quiz is missed for valid reasons approved
											by the instructor, no zero grade will be assigned but there will be no retake either.
											There is zero tolerance policy on the use of AI (e.g., ChatGPT) or plagiarism in general during
											quizzes or tests, any offense will result in a grade of zero and will be reported to
											<a href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html" target="_blank">Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs</a>.

										<p>
											<h3 align="left"><b style="font-weight: bold">Grading:</b> (tentative and subject to change)</h3>
											The final grade will be based upon the following components (all submissions are due at midnight):
											<ul>
												<li> <a href="ecs165a-winter2026/milestones/PreMilestone.pdf" target="_blank"><b style="font-weight: bold">Individual Pre-milestone Assignment:</b></a> 5% (Due on January 17, 2026)</li>

										<p>
											<h3 align="left"><b style="font-weight: bold">Communication:</b></h3>
											For communication with the instructor, please use email (<a href="#">msadoghi@ucdavis.edu</a>)
											and not Canvas. The instructor will not check/reply to Canvas messages.

											<br>
											<br>

											For group communication (monitored by TAs) and other students, we will rely on
											<a href="https://piazza.com/ucdavis/winter2026/ecs165a" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.
										</p>


										<p>
											<h3 align="left"><b style="font-weight: bold">Course Policy:</b></h3>
											In this class, we adhere to the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct (<a href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
											We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding the use of AI (e.g., ChatGPT)
											and plagiarism during quizzes and term papers. Any violation will result
											in a grade of zero and will be reported to the Office of Student Support
											and Judicial Affairs. You may use AI tools as an assistant to learn and explore,
											but not AI-generated code. You cannot just ask AI tools to write the code for you.
											It is your responsibility to check with the instructor to confirm that your
											use of AI is allowed. <br><br>

											In addition, late submission will result in a 10% penalty for each day
											late; at most, an extension of up to two days may be granted. Students are
											strongly advised that any act of cheating will result in a score of 0
											for the entire milestone (or the course), and offenses will be
											reported to the Office of the Dean of Students. You are encouraged to discuss
											problems and ideas, but the final solution or code must be your own. In the
											event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and grading
											percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised quarter
											calendar. If such	unusual circumstances arise, students may determine any such
											changes by contacting the instructor.
