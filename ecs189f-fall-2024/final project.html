									<h4>Purpose</h4>
									<p>
										All students are expected to work in teams on an exciting, open-ended,
									blockchain-related, quarter-long project, in a sense, operating and simulating
									startup environments. Needless to say, this rewarding experience is accompanied by a
									significant exploration and development effort that spans hands-on experience on
									a variety of blockchain technologies.
									</p>

									<p>
									This course is complementary to the classical well-formed, prescriptive model of
									assignments/projects that are indeed effective and invaluable in practice. Instead by
									design, the course project is intended to be open-ended, namely, minimal instructions and
									requirements will be provided, as such it rewards and values research &amp; development,
									taking risks, above all, it is aimed to foster and tap into the creativity of each individual.
									</p>
									</div>

									<div class="box">
									<h4>Project Description</h4>
									<p>
										The project must be done in groups of five students, and the role and contributions of each
										group member must be clearly articulated. The outcome of the final project will consist of the following.
										(1) Designing novel consensus protocols; benchmarking and studying existing consensus
										protocols; developing novel techniques or architectures to improve the performance
										of a blockchain fabric (e.g., sharding, cross-chain, hybrid protocols);
										or developing novel applications for blockchain (e.g., DeFi applications).
										(2) Writing a grant proposal for startup seed funding or a short research paper with the
										ultimate goal of submitting to a top-tier conference, of course, submission is optional
										and does not affect your final grade. All project reports must be written in LaTex using
										<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM templates</a>
										or in a form of detailed and accessible blog or professional website
										(e.g., <a href="https://resilientdb.com/blog/2021/08/21/PBFT_Commit.html" target="_blank">Blog</a>,
													 <a href="https://expolab.org/ecs189f-fall-2020/Projects/CryptoLunch/index.html" target="_blank">CryptoLunch</a>,
													 <a href="https://expolab.org/ecs189f-fall-2020/Projects/ResilientRecords/index.html" target="_blank">Resilient Record</a>).
										<i> All projects must be approved and supervised by the instructor and all projects must
										utilize <a href="https://resilientdb.com/" target="_blank">ResilientDB Fabric</a>
										unless prior approval of the instructor is granted.
									</i>
									</p>

									<p>
									<h5>Grant Proposal</h5>
									Whether you choose the grant proposal or research paper route, there needs to be a proof-of-concept
									prototype of your ideas in order to demonstrate <i>feasibility</i> or <i>effectiveness</i>. For the
									<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20527/nsf20527.htm" target="_blank">grant proposal</a> track,
									we will adopt the well-known
									<a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)</a>
									program that fosters commercialization of research ideas by small businesses. SBIR project
									description template can be found
									<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20527/nsf20527.htm#ProjectDesc" target="_blank">here</a>.
									</p>


									<p>
									For the research paper track, we adopt standard conference-style paper such as
									(<a href="http://vldb.org/pvldb/contributions_vol14.html" target="_blank">PVLDB</a> or
									<a href="https://2021.sigmod.org/calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml" target="_blank">SIGMOD</a>).
									An example of a well-written blockchain research paper would be
									<a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p868-gupta.pdf" target="_blank">ResilientDB</a>, and
									many more examples can be found in our <a href="https://expolab.org/ecs265-fall2020.html" target="_blank">ECS265</a> course.
								</p>

									<p>
									<h5>Research Paper</h5>
									A research papers (and/or presentation slides) would consist of the following key components

									<ol>

									<li>Motivation (why this problem is important and interesting)</li>

									<li>Gap (what are the challenges and what are the shortcomings of the most relevant work)</li>

									<li>Problem statement</li>

									<li>Key intuitions behind your proposed approach and sketch of the solution in a top-down approach</li>

									<li>Empirical results (e.g., latency, throughput, precision, recall, f-measure, etc.)</li>

									<li>List of contributions and their importance (both scientific and technical contributions)</li>

									<li>Conclusions</li>

									<li>Future Directions/Next Steps</li>
								</ol>
								</p>

									<h5>Benchmarking Paper</h5>
									A benchmarking papers (and/or presentation slides) would consist	 of the following key components

									<li>Gap (what are the challenges and what are the shortcomings of the most relevant benchmarking work)</li>

									<li>Problem statement</li>

									<li>A brief survey/discussion of relevant approaches/systems</li>

									<li>Justification for choosing these approaches/systems</li>

									<li>Evaluation Methodology: <br>
										machines/cluster requirements &amp; setup,
                    single-node and multi-nodes configurations
                    in-memory vs. disk-based approaches,
                    selected systems/engines,
                    data workloads (synthetic data and/or real data),
                    query workloads,

									<h4>Project Check-in &amp; Feedback</h4>
									<p>
									It is important that tangible progress is made every week. Progress
									must be captured in slides and can be any of the following categories.
									To make healthy progress, we need to satisfy one or more of the categories
									below each week. Of course, there could be an exception if you have several
									tests/exams, etc. in one week. But generally, it is important to have a
									consistent and healthy momentum.

									To make steady progress, at least one of the categories below must
									be fulfilled each week.
									<ul>
										<li>Proposing a new well-thought idea (captured clearly on the slide),</li>
										<li>Solidifying an existing idea or algorithm (captured clearly on the slide),</li>
										<li>Providing correctness or time/space complexity proofs of the proposed algorithms/protocols,</li>
										<li>Formulating a set of new challenges with partial solutions (also captured clearly on the slides),</li>
										<li>Developing a module of the ongoing research prototype,</li>
										<li>Reporting detailed implementation progress,</li>
										<li>Evaluating and presenting a set of experimental results, and/or</li>
										<li>Completing the write-up for several sections of a research paper</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

									<div class="box">
									<h4>Team Dynamics</h4>
									<p>
									For each group, it is recommended that each member lead one aspect of the project while
									contributing and learning about other parts. It is further recommended a project manager
									is elected within a group to coordinate all efforts and manage the group dynamics in addition
									to making technical contributions to the project.
									</p>

									<p>
									A fact of life, when there is group work, whether at school or in society, there are
									occasional conflicts; and it is crucial to learn how to resolve our differences and be
									receptive, open, and kind to one another. In kindness and reflection, we shall aim to
									resolve all conflicts. It is the group's responsibility to handle all internal affairs,
									and only when absolutely necessary involving the instructor. But note, only under very
									rare exceptional circumstances, a group re-structuring would be granted because once the
									group is formed, at least for 10 weeks, we must learn how to work with each other in harmony.
									</p>
